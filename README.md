## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

How to use CSS vars (very easy, was just stalling), many other things from using grid to help with spacing, different ways to contain elements to be more responsive, rules to put on parent containers in turn savings extra steps (overflow:hidden on parent containers instead of images). Again, many different things from this one project.
